Palindrome Checker

This program is a console application that checks if a given input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

How It Works:
1. The user is prompted to enter a line of text.
2. The program filters out any characters that are not alphanumeric and converts the text to lowercase.
3. It then places each character from the cleaned input string into a queue.
4. Characters are dequeued from the queue and compared with the original string to verify if it's a palindrome.
5. Finally, the program displays whether the input text is a palindrome or not.

Instructions:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a line of text when prompted.
3. The program will determine if the text is a palindrome or not and display the result.

Note: Palindromes are case-insensitive and ignore non-alphanumeric characters during comparison.
